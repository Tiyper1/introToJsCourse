### Primitive Data Types

- string
- number
- boolean
- undefined
- null

### Non Primitive Data Types

### Strings
- The string data type is used to represent textual data
- it is a set of elements of 16-bit unsigned integer values
- Each element string occupies a position  in the String
    - for example the first element is at index 0 and the next one is at index 1, and so on 

#### Example of a string 
     /*
      * A JavaScript string can be surrounded by double-quotes or single-quotes
      * which ever you use doesn't matter just make sure you are consistant 
      * you can also escape a double or single quote with in the string which
      * you will see in the below example
      */
      
      //String surrounded by a single quote 
      console.log('Hello, World!');
      
      //String surrounded by a double quote
      console.log("Hello, World!");
      
      //Escaping a single quote 
      console.log('Dont\'t');
      
      //Escaping a double quote
      console.log("This is a \"quote\"");
      
      //using a single quote inside a double quote 
      console.log('This is a "quote"');

## Lets examine the previous example

#### main.js
        //Instruct Console to log statement Hello, World!
        console.log("Hello, World!");

In the previous example we added a line with 2 forward slashes, this denotes an inline comment which is used to comment your JavaScript code. You can also add a multi-line comment which is done a little differently. The below example illustrate the how to write comments in JavaScript

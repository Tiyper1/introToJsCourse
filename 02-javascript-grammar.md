# JavaScript Grammar 

## Lets examine the previous example

#### main.js
        //Instruct Console to log statement Hello, World!
        console.log("Hello, World!");

In the previous example we added a line with 2 forward slashes, this denotes an inline comment which is used to comment your JavaScript code. You can also add a multi-line comment which is done a little differently. The below example illustrate the how to write comments in JavaScript.

#### Example of a inline comment      
        //Example of a inline comment

#### Example of a multi-line comment        
        /*
         * This is an example of 
         * a multi-line comment
         */

#### JavaScript Statements
Each line of JavaScript code is considered a statement, so the **console.log("Hello, World!");** that we wrote in the main.js would be considered a JavaScript statement.

#### Terminating a Statement         
Going back to the previous example you might of also noticed a semicolon at the end of the statment, this is called terminating a statement. While JavaScript will not return an error if you forget most of the time, it is good practice to always terminate your JavaScript statement.

#### Block Code 
You will also come across code that is surrounded by curly braces, this is referred to as **block code**.

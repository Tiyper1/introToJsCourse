# Introduction

### About the course
This course is designed for individuals who are new to JavaScript or have some experience with the language but want to get a solid foundation in working with the JavaScript programming language.

### History or JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich a programmer at Netscape back in the 1990's. He was asked to create a new language for the companies flagship browser Netscape Navigator so that there was a way to add some interaction.

Within 10 days Brendan came up with what was called LiveScript, which then was renamed to JavaScript for marketing reasons.
Although JavaScript starts with *Java* the two languages have very little in common. This is because at the time Java was the more popular programming language and Netscape's marketing department wanted to capitalize on this. 

### Popularity of JavaScript 
With support for JavaScript in version 2 of Netscape's Navigator in 1995 users were able to use JavaScript to add interaction to their webpages which they couldn't do before. For instance you were able to do from validation on the client side before the form was submitted to the server. This was great because validation was first checked on the client side before going to the server, rather than just having validation on the backend.

With the popularity of JavaScript Microsoft came out with their own version of JavaScript which they called JScript. With Netscape and Microsoft supporting their versions of JavaScript many developers were abusing the way JavaScript was being used, for example creating popup ads which would popup when a user would open a website. 

### Standardizing JavaScript
At some point Netscape and Sun Microsystems descided to standardize the language along with the help of the European Computer Manufacturers Association, who would host the standard. The Standardized language would come to be known as ECMAScript. This caused further confusion amongst the development community which would get confused with exactly what ECMAScript was and what JavaScript was.
The change in name was to avoid infringing on Sun's Java trademark name so when someone says ECMAScript they are referring to the standard and when someone mentions JavaScript they are usually referring to the language. The difference is that ECMAScript is a standard that vendors can interprit in a different way then another vendor and JavaScript is referred to JavaScript in the browser.

### Evolution of JavaScript
The Browser Wars was a fight that started with Netscape and Microsoft for dominance of the browser market by add new features to their browsers that were usually not supported with other browsers, this lead to having JavaScript not working in the same way from one browser to another or not at all. As more vendors started to take the standards more seriously many of the inconsistencies have been removed, but still some remain.

With vendors starting to listen to the needs of developers and the ECMAScript standard matured with each new release, JavaScript allowed developers do create web apps that acted more like a native desktop application thanks to the help of such technologies as Ajax short for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML which allowed a webpage to get data from a server without refresh the page and with the development of Google's V8 JavaScript enigne which allowed browsers to load webpages faster.

### Furture of JavaScript
In 2009 with he introduction of Node.js, JavaScript was finally ported over to the server. This meant that for the first time you can write a website using just one programming language for the front and back end using frontend and backend frameworks such as AngularJS and Express.js.

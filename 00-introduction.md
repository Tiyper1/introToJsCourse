# Introduction

### About the course
This course is designed for individuals who are new to JavaScript or have some experience with the language but want to get a solid foundation in working with the JavaScript programming language.

### History or JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich a programmer at Netscape back in the 1990's. He was asked to create a new language for the companies flagship browser Netscape Communicator so that there was a way to add some interaction.
Within 10 days Brendan came up with what was called LiveScript, which then was renamed to JavaScript for marketing reasons.
Although JavaScript starts with *Java* the two languages have very little in common. This is because at the time Java was the more popular programming language and Netscape's marketing department wanted to capitalize on this.
